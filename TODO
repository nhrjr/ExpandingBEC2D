TODO:

- why 512 working but 1024 not in ITP checkings?
- radialDensity why these spikes? -> I checked the behaviour and I think it comes from the assignement of cartesian discrete to polar coordinates. This is complicated
- why are the fucking occupation plot so thick now, where does it come from? wtf?



GENERAL:
- the whole integral/rescaling thing
- expanding speeds, maybe a dynamic system, like ITP things for expansion?
- think about the radial k in terms of expansion, rest of k definition should be good now.


- RPATH handling of Cmake, check cmake wiki.
